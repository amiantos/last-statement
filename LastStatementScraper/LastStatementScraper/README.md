#  LastStatementScraper

This is a simple macOS app for automatically scraping the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website for executions and formatting them into a JSON file for export. At the moment the outputted JSON is printed to console for you to copy and paste wherever it is needed.

It would be best if, in the future, this scraper downloaded the existing executions.json file from the remote host and did not overwrite any previously existing executions that may have been edited/corrected by hand.
